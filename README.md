# AI-Powered Automated SRS Generator

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Under%20Development-yellow)

## Abstract

Many software projects fail due to vague or incomplete requirements given by non-technical clients. Writing a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) requires expertise, which many clients and small teams lack.

Our proposed solution is an **AI-powered Automated SRS Generator**. Through a chat interface, clients can describe their project idea in plain English. The system uses NLP and AI to:

- Ask clarifying questions
- Suggest missing requirements
- Generate a complete **IEEE 830-compliant SRS**
- Produce **UML diagrams** (use-case, class, sequence)
- Provide basic **wireframes** of the system

This will save time, reduce miscommunication, and make requirement engineering accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

## Justification

Traditionally, System Analysts or Requirements Engineers gather client requirements and write the SRS with supporting diagrams. However, this is time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error.

Recent tools like Almware, Reqi's "Rex," and Blueprint.AI show early attempts to automate requirement documentation, but they lack interactive clarification, missing requirement suggestions, and visual model generation. Our project combines all these aspects into one assistant.

This project bridges the gap between clients and developers by acting like a junior Requirements Engineer. It adds academic value (NLP, AI, automation) and industrial value (time and cost savings in requirement engineering).

## Objectives

- Develop a **chat-based interface** where clients describe requirements
- Implement **AI-driven clarification** (chatbot asks follow-up questions)
- Add a **knowledge base/ML model** to suggest missing requirements
- Generate **IEEE 830-compliant SRS** documents
- Automatically create **UML diagrams** (use-case, class, sequence)
- Optionally generate basic **UI wireframes**
- Ensure usability, scalability, and security of the platform

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Interactive AI-based requirement gathering
- Automated SRS generation (IEEE 830)
- UML diagrams (use-case, class, sequence)
- Wireframe prototypes
- Exportable reports (PDF/DOCX)

### Out of Scope
- Full system implementation for client projects
- Advanced UI/UX prototyping beyond basic wireframes
- Domain-specific deep knowledge bases (initially general best practices only)

## Tools and Technologies

- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS (chat interface, diagram display)
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/FastAPI)
- **AI/NLP:** Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, OpenAI API or open-source model
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
- **Diagram Generation:** PlantUML / Mermaid.js
- **Wireframes:** Mermaid wireframes
- **Deployment:** Docker + Cloud (AWS/Heroku/Vercel)
- **Collaboration:** GitHub, CI/CD pipelines

## Potential Impact

- **Academic:** Demonstrates AI + NLP in requirements engineering, publishable research
- **Industrial:** Saves time, reduces cost of hiring analysts, improves project success rate
- **Social:** Makes software development accessible for non-technical founders/startups

- [Software Requirements Specifications](documentation/Software%20Requirements%20Specifications.pdf)

## Data Normalization

Normalize the sample requirements and SRS templates into JSONL for RAG:

```bash
python cli/normalize_data.py
```

Preview a few normalized records:

```bash
python cli/preview_normalized.py --limit 5
```

## Clarification Loop (Demo)

Generate initial clarification questions from a user idea:

```bash
python cli/clarification_demo.py --input "We want a web app that turns ideas into SRS documents"
```

## OpenRouter Clarification App

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the interactive CLI (dry run skips the API call):

```bash
python cli/openrouter_app.py --dry-run
```

Stream the LLM response:

```bash
python cli/openrouter_app.py --stream
```

Use embeddings-based RAG (OpenRouter embeddings model):

```bash
$env:OPENROUTER_EMBED_MODEL="openai/text-embedding-3-small"
python cli/openrouter_app.py --rag embed
```

Precompute embeddings once (recommended for speed):

```bash
python cli/build_embeddings.py
```

Use local CPU embeddings (no OpenRouter required):

```bash
python cli/build_embeddings.py --model sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 --device cpu
```
+
+## Backend API
+
+Start the server with Uvicorn:
+
+```bash
+cd backend
+uvicorn api:app --reload --port 8000
+```
+
+Sample requests:
+
+```bash
+# start session
+curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/graph/start -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"idea":"A fish game"}'
+
+# step with answer
+curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/graph/step -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
+     -d '{"session_id":"<id>","answer":"eating round bubbles"}'
+```
```

Set your OpenRouter key and run live:

```bash
$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key-here"
python cli/openrouter_app.py
```

Or place the key in a root `.env` file:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-key-here
OPENROUTER_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini
OPENROUTER_HTTP_REFERER=https://your-site.example
OPENROUTER_APP_TITLE=Your App Name
```
